(1, 'sifath', 'The Oracle Test', 'Sifath I jump at the sound of a creaking floorboard. The wind is howling, the trees are shaking wildly; their branches bending this way and that as if possessed and their leaves are rattling eerily. The inky black of the night sky is hidden behind wispy silver clouds, the moon is gleaming luminously and the stars are shining particularly bright. All of these things I take as indicators to mean that something is about to happen.\r\nI shiver, even though itï¿½s humid, and I feel my skin crawling all over; my scalp, my arms, my toes, my lips, and even between my legs. The hairs on my arms are standing on end, looking as if theyï¿½ve received tons of static and an unfamiliar emotion causes a lump to form in my throat.\r\nThen, I hear them - the voices, and Iï¿½m certain that my heart has stopped beating. I struggle to take a breath and my vision blurs... then clears. Itï¿½s as if the fog that has just clouded my vision, impairing my eyesight, is a cleaner that someone sprayed on them so that when the murkiness is wiped away, I can see far better; I can see the detail, notice the near imperceptible queerness of certain objects that I had previously thought was normal, and observe the peculiarities of invisible energy footprints that have been left behind by those that reside here.\r\nJust as I am readjusting to the sudden clarity that has overcome me, they start to emerge. Drifting through the peeling yellow walls, rising up through the old wooden floorboards, sinking down through the ceiling, randomly appearing at certain points in the room - theyï¿½re everywhere.\r\nAll at once, everything stops. Itï¿½s like someoneï¿½s pressed pause on time and everything, everyone, has halted in their tracks. The trees are calm, the wind has stilled, and the clouds have danced away, revealing the dark beauty of the night sky for all to behold. But most importantly, they have stopped advancing, and stand, frozen, their eyes fixed on some unseen wonder in the distance.\r\nThatï¿½s when I hear the footsteps; loud, distinct, echoing footsteps that radiate power, each step sentencing doom. I steel myself, tell myself to be brave, and I peer out the window; searching the spellbinding nightï¿½s depths for the source of all this mysterious and blood chilling magic - the owner of the footsteps.\r\nMy breath catches in my throat as my eyes take in the sight of her for the first time. Sheï¿½s an enigmatic shadow, swathed in flowing black cloths, sweeping past the crumbling brick wall without pause, continuing to make her direct and foreboding way down the winding pathway and to my front door.\r\nThereï¿½s a knock at the door and I walk steadily towards it. I know that if I donï¿½t open it, she will enter the house anyway so I might as well invite her in and show her that Iï¿½m not afraid of her presence, to show her that I am not a weakling and that she cannot just rock up and take over me, my life or my sanity.\r\nI take a shaky breath, drawing from a reserve of courage deep within me that I didnï¿½t even know I had. Commanding that calm and bravery to spread through my whole being, and forcing my face to be expressionless, I grasp the door knob firmly and swing it open, ordering my newfound strength of character not to falter.\r\nWith the door now opened, nothing is separating the two of us and we stand face to face, silently regarding one another and sizing each other up. Nothing is said for several minutes.\r\nï¿½You are required to fulfil your designated duty and become the next Oracle,ï¿½ she finally states, a superior knowledge and calm prevalent in her eyes.\r\nï¿½Explain,ï¿½ I respond, my tone equally measured.\r\nï¿½The Oracle of Delphi requires a new form in order to function appropriately and honour promises made to the current form of the Oracle.ï¿½\r\nï¿½The Oracle of Delphi is extinct, commanded by Emperor Theodosius I back in 395 AD to cease operation along with all other pagan temples,ï¿½ I reply, inwardly surprised and confused as to where this knowledge came from.\r\nï¿½In theory, yes. And yet the Oracle and her legacy lives on. You believe it too, even though you donï¿½t want to.ï¿½\r\nI open my mouth to object but then I realise that she is right. I do believe her. Call me gullible if you want, but all the creepy, magical stuff has really gotten to me and I feel like I have no choice but to believe her.\r\nï¿½Whatï¿½s the deal? You get to possess me or whatever and then I get out of it what exactly?ï¿½ My eyes widen when I realise what Iï¿½ve just said to the powerful being before me.\r\nShe regards me, eyebrow arched for a few moments and then a cool smile spreads slowly across her face. ï¿½Youï¿½ve got spunk, kid.ï¿½ Her words take me aback. When she says this she sounds almost, well, human. The Oracle shakes her head and then resumes her serious, carefully controlled speech, ï¿½To answer your question, you need to become the next Oracle. The current Oracle form is beginning to decay, so I need a new body.ï¿½\r\nI laugh sarcastically, ï¿½Decayed? You look like youï¿½re about 25 in your current form. How can you possibly be decaying?! Oh and no biggy about the whole, you know, possessing me and taking control of my body.ï¿½\r\nï¿½Your words bore me and your attitude irritates me,ï¿½ the Oracle responds monotonously, yet I see the fire in her eyes. ï¿½My current form is physically able. Not so mentally. If I stay inside of her much longer, my spirit will drive her insane and I promised her that I wouldnï¿½t allow for that to happen. I fully intend to keep my promise.ï¿½\r\nï¿½Is that a threat?ï¿½ I challenge her, looking her square in the eye.\r\nï¿½No,ï¿½ the Oracle replies simply. ï¿½Itï¿½s fact.ï¿½ She must sense my confusion and rising annoyance because she elaborates, ï¿½You were born to be an Oracle. You posses the mind, resilience, willpower and inner strength. And you can see them,ï¿½ she inclines her head in the direction of the spirits that I didnï¿½t even realise had begun to gather around me, imprisioning me in a sphere of expectant stares.\r\nï¿½When I enter and join with your soul, we will meld together, you and I, until the next Oracle form is ready. I will leave you and enter the next Oracle form before my presence can upset your psychological wellbeing. Now you were asking previously what exactly you would get out of being an Oracle form,ï¿½ she pauses, ï¿½Once your service as the Oracle form is complete, you will be set up for life. Some Oracle forms become famous, others become rich, some marry a modern Prince Charming, some become one of the most beautiful people in the world. The point is, youï¿½ll get something - a hidden desire, most likely.ï¿½\r\nï¿½That sounds like a tempting offer, really, but uh... What if I refuse?ï¿½\r\nThe Oracle freezes in place, her gaze suddenly cold. Lethal cold. If looks could kill Iï¿½d be dead cold. ï¿½If you refuse,ï¿½ the Oracle starts, her voice measured and piercing. ï¿½Then you are sentencing the current Oracle form to madness. I have nowhere else to go so that means I cannot keep my promise to her and will remain in her body until the next Oracle comes along. She will be left insane once I swap forms.ï¿½\r\nI gulp. ï¿½Oh,ï¿½ is all I manage to get out.\r\nï¿½And if you refuse,ï¿½ the Oracle continues as if I never spoke, ï¿½My current form will haunt you until your death. Youï¿½ll be constantly reminded that you, not I, was the one that sentenced her to her fate.ï¿½\r\nHer words reverberated throughout the house long after she finished talking. Horror, pure and terrifying, races through my veins. If I refuse, I am practically sentencing the current Oracle form to her death and if I accept, well, I have to be the living breathing form of the Oracle for who-knows-how-long.\r\n', 13, 11),
(6, 'sifath', 'Bonfire', 'Its all started two months ago. Weâ€™d just moved house. Mum and dad were to busy unpacking to even notice anything happen to me. Not that they would have noticed anyway.\r\nI had no friends, no nothing. It was awful. One day we passed an old man praying and burning paper. The fire seemed to look at me, though itâ€™s hard to describe, I could have sworn the fire said to me: Flame maid.\r\nI was so freaked out. Thatâ€™s when I became so paranoid about fire. My previous nightmares involve a burning building which Iâ€™m stuck in, then the fire says: Have a nice burn!\r\nThen, last week, my fingernails turned orange. Luckily my parents thought Iâ€™d painted them. The next day, tiny flames started flickering out of my palm. It didnâ€™t hurt me, it just scared me. Iâ€™d spent the day shut in my room, clenching my palm so tightly my fingernails left prints.\r\nSince then, Iâ€™d learnt how to control it. But still...if my parents found out...and my sister, Posy... Posy is only four. Sheâ€™s just learnt to say my name: Cassie. Sheâ€™s settled in marvelously in the new house.\r\nOur house is old and creaky. The doors creak, the stairs moan, and the toilet makes weird gurgling sounds. But I have my own room, next to Posyâ€™s.\r\nIâ€™m starting school next week. Iâ€™m so nervous. The move let me not have to interact with other people, but now Iâ€™ve got to go to school with my not-so-under-control-power.\r\nItâ€™s so unrealistic, I bet itâ€™s a dream. Tomorrow morning Iâ€™ll wake up and tell my family over breakfast. Only I know it is real. The leaves on the trees have way to much details and my sister can only throw tantrums in real life.\r\nSometimes I wonder if my life was just that. That, and nothing else.', 2, 1),
(7, 'sifath', 'The Tides Bringins', 'Isip my cherry lemonade with a sigh as my sister continues pleading with me.\r\nâ€œPlease, please, pretty please with a cherry on top?â€ Callie pleads, her brown eyes boring into my green ones.\r\nI was on a beach chair relaxing for once. Usually I was neck deep in work, but finally took my friendsâ€™ advice and planned a break. Today, I was on San Pedro. I usually came here to fish and observe marine life, hence my career as a marine biologist.\r\nâ€œWhy canâ€™t I come with you? We could have lots of fun! I mean, sisters are supposed to bond. But youâ€™re gone so much, I feel like an only child. Mom and Dad would agree with me!â€ Callie continues her ranting and I sigh. She was right, after all. I was gone too much, and to be honest, I really missed my family. But their location in another country, also known as Canada, wasnâ€™t exactly easy to get to.\r\nMy sister, on the other hand, was the exact opposite of me. Not only did she have my fatherâ€™s looks with me my momâ€™s, but she was as carefree as I was strict. Callie loved travelling and helping children in different countries all across the world. And yet, she got to see the family more than me.\r\nâ€œYou know what?â€ I finally respond. Callieâ€™s eyes fill with hope at the statement that I was to make. â€œIf you can pass the vitals test, you can tag along with me.â€ Callie squeals and reaches over to me.\r\nâ€œNo, donâ€™t, Callie-â€œ I end abruptly as Callie pulls me in a great bear hug.\r\nâ€œThis is my reward for agreeing with you? I am so gonna regret this.â€\r\nI had just agreed to let my older sister come with me on a submarine expedition thousands of feet underwater for weeks, with no contact above ground.

(8, 'sifath', 'Games Unify', 'The low hum of the coffee machine behind the counter filled the space as individuals passed through the cafe ordering their daily espresso or other delicacies. I noticed a number of high schoolers grabbing their doses of caffeine, probably preparing for their late morning exams. All of this was bathed in a warm light inside the shop. Couples chatted, filling the coffee shop with the pleasant sound of conversation. Despite the warm atmosphere, our group of five surrounding one of the many tables was dead silent.\r\nSylvia and I exchanged looks, and I noticed sometimes that she would dart quick glances at Triston. He mustâ€™ve found the dark brown liquid in his mug very interesting, because if they made eye contact for even a second, Triston turned his gaze to his coffee cup. I could not help but notice the way both their expressions seemed to soften, almost as if they were both feeling a little dejected. Triston had at first struck me as shy, but I could tell his ability to get closer to people was affected by a greater cause. Sylvia was always so bright and cheerful with everyone, except Bruce of course. Even so, she seemed to act differently around the boy with black hair and glasses.\r\nSomething was definitely happening between the two them.\r\nI decided that matter could wait until after weâ€™d discussed the events that had occurred inside Combat Sorcier Online.\r\nWe each sat there silently contemplating the situation. After a while, Anna cleared her throat. â€œSomething happened last night,â€ she murmured. She too, apparently found her latte captivating as she refused to meet any of our gazes. I caught a quick glimpse of Will Ferris squeezing her hand under the table.\r\nThen Anna took a deep breath and sighed. She looked up and stared at me directly, her crystal gray eyes striking. A small smile graced her face. â€œI canâ€™t tell you how happy I am that you guys joined our guild. I think we will all make a really good team,â€ she said.\r\nAfter those kind words, her eyebrows furrowed and her scowl returned. â€œHopefully weâ€™re not more trouble than weâ€™re worth,â€ Will Ferris laughed drily. He put his arm across Annaâ€™s shoulders and pulled her closer to him. Her expression softened slightly, just enough to make Will grin. They were clearly very important to each other.\r\nâ€œNow,â€ Anna said sternly. It was that same tone sheâ€™d used before our battles in the tournament, and the expression was familiar too. She looked serious a lot of the time, but when Anna smiled she looked beautiful. She wasnâ€™t smiling now, as her lips were curled in a look of distaste. She simply clutched her latte tightly in her hands. â€œAfter the tournament, Chris discovered that he had lost a large amount of gold, and that a few items he had been holding in his inventory had disappeared. I canâ€™t explain this quite yet. Then when I got home, I was online with Will Ferris. We were out hunting when we came upon a single ghost knight.â€\r\nhj', 1, 0),
(9, 'sifath', 'The Mecca', 'Misty Cliffs is a town of secrecy, suspicion, and disappearance. Misty Cliffs is a town so small, that on a map, you could cover it with a pinâ€™s head. But Misty Cliffs has something deeper underneath. And no one knows it. But thatâ€™s about to change.\r\nI stop, my pencil hovering above my notebook. I remember what happened over the past month or so. Misty Cliffs, I think, smiling to myself, used to be an invisible little town where no one went and no one left. Now, though, after the huge counterfeiting conspiracy had been revealed, after all those kids were found, the newspapers favor Misty Cliffs. Dustey and I are favored, too, because of what we did.\r\nMuch has changed. And I am writing it down. I do want to be the next Sherlock Holmes, and now I have my chance. I grin.\r\nIt all started on a dampish morning...\r\nOn the second Sunday of May thereâ€™s always a town gathering. Misty Cliffs is small enough to have everyone gathered in the Misty Mateyâ€™s Mighty Oâ€™s factory parking lot. Or maybe the parking lot is so big it can fit everyone from Misty Cliffs in it.\r\nA scaffold-like thing is raised on one end of the parking lot, and the sometime mayor and school principal Ms. Wellman stands on it, looking over the crowd. She has a red-and-white megaphone in her hand and was scanning the crowd through her nose-pinching spectacles when my family pulls into the parking lot. We get out of the car and join the rest of the town. My sister holds Dadâ€™s hand, and Mom has her arms crossed.\r\nOur family is especially nervous at this meeting, partly because I am in middle school and partly because I am along.\r\nDad glances at his watch. 10:03. He frowns. It isnâ€™t like Ms. Wellman to start late, but then, there are still cars pulling into the lot.\r\nWellman clears her throat, the megaphone amplifying the sound.\r\nâ€œGood morning, Misty Cliffs.â€\r\nMaybe it was â€˜Good throwing Nifty Spiffs.â€™\r\nâ€œToday is the seggend Sundee of Me, and yeâ€™ll know ut that means. Ahem.â€ She clears her throat and tries again, articulating carefully. â€œToday is the second Sunday of May and you all know what that means.\r\nâ€œThe Fourteen are chosen.â€\r\nWeary, frightened whispers circulate the crowd. Middle schoolers are hugged closer. I stand partly away from my family. If I am chosen, I donâ€™t want them to think it hurts me.\r\nâ€œThis year, the eighth graders chosen are...â€ she clears her throat again and puts down the megaphone. She pulls out an envelope and opens it.\r\nNow, before you get any ideas, Iâ€™d better explain this to you. The Fourteen are fourteen eighth graders chosen once yearly. They get to go on an â€˜exclusiveâ€™ trip to a science museum in the middle of the woods.', 1, 2),
(10, 'sifath', 'Storm Stolen', 'Grey storm clouds swirled overhead, blocking out any hopes of sunshine. Solemn were any birds that dared fly past the foreboding sky. All houses were locked, windows boarded up, and no person was to be seen outside. The animals had gone into hiding too, for the same reason. They could sense the storm.\r\nNot a single car chugged down the ever barren street; and the corn plants swayed in the growing strength of the howling wind. The tree branches bent, and swayed, threatening to come crashing down on the Pistado Household. I watched all this from a crack in my boarded up window. You see, my family had been preparing for a Tornado ever since September. But It wasnâ€™t that unusual for there to be solitary movement in the streets of Shillingville. Shillingville is a small town in the middle of Oklahoma. Itâ€™s not on most maps, for many reasons. If you go to my school, it mostly explains itself.\r\nShillingville Elementary is a one room, one teacher school, that teaches Kindergarten through Fifth Grade. Our teacher, Ms. Mirabile, deserves to work as a tutor for the queen. She is the kindest, sweetest person I have ever met (sorry mom). But I wouldnâ€™t want her to get promoted, because then sheâ€™d go work for some fancy Prep school, and Iâ€™d be stuck with Mr. Vanderbilt.\r\nMr. Vanderbilt comes to teach us whenever Ms. Mirabile has to go away. He assumes we have more fun with him, than Ms. Mirabile, but he thought wrong. He makes us do college level exams, says that they â€œboost our level of knowledgeâ€, but they actually just lower your self esteem, especially for the 5th Graders, when you get a -100 on your test. the K-2nd grade havenâ€™t learned negative numbersâ€™ so theyâ€™re ok. But still.\r\nMy best friend, Patrick, has been rapped on the knuckles twice with a ruler. Since its still legal in Oklahoma to do that, Mr. Vanderbilt wonâ€™t go to jail, to my great disappointment, but he does get reprimanded by the parents. A lot. Last week, there had been the start of some of the hottest weather Shillingville has ever seen in Autumn. Not the whole tumbleweeds, cactuses, and sandstorms, that you may be picturing. But the temperatures started soaring up into the hundreds. Last Thursday, it was 108 degrees outside. Just an hour ago, a tornado warning was broadcasted, for most of Oklahoma.\r\nEveryone scrambled to board up their windows and doors. We stocked up on food, and bottled water, and we made room in the basement for the family. We have a small basement, so making room for my parents, me, my brother Phillip, and my terrier Donald, wasnâ€™t easy; but this wasnâ€™t exactly a new thing, living in Oklahoma. Then, at 10:34 pm, the tornado struck us. We all scrambled into the basement, as the winds screamed bloody murder, tearing up plants and trees by their roots. I imagined the tornado tearing up my house, and smashing it to bits on the dead grass. â€œDonâ€™t worry, Donald,â€ I whispered to him, as he whimpered; but I was mostly trying to reassure myself. I squeezed Donald tighter and reached out for Phillipâ€™s hand as the Tornado plowed through Oakland County. Even though I had been through hundreds of Tornadoes, living one was really scary. I needed some reassurance from a friend right now. I dug through the jumble of people until I found my phone, and dialed Patrickâ€™s number', 0, 0),

I wish, most of all, that the only person left with the power to fix the entire situation hadnâ€™t been me.\r\nThe world had needed someone stronger, braver, in its hour of needâ€” an hour frozen forever.

The Professor never talked; he seemed to carry a deep sadness along with him, but at the same time, he smiled politely all the time.\r\nHe seemed to have a history, unlike the others. The other guests were paper-thin, their travels meaningless. Everything went right through them. The Professor seemed to hold everything.\r\nMother was tilting the tray forward in impatience, which brought the tea to the rim of the cup.

He expects it at exactly 4.â€\r\nI nodded in return and quickly dashed up the stairwell, lightly kicking the steps with my worn leather shoes.

She bragged about it to everyone, and soon enough she was taken by the government. We never saw her again.â€\r\nâ€œAnyway, the three pure powers. Crysos is the most powerful. The first Crysos had the ability to shape shift. He could turn into any being he chose. Argenia, she had huge silver wings which she could fold into her skin, hiding from view, yet when she unfurled them, they were huge and magnificent. Aeris had the ability to move at super speeds, yet stay as graceful as a ballet dancer.â€\r\nâ€œSo there you have it, class. That is the history of our existence, summarised of course. None of us know all the exact details. Most of it we only found out a few decades ago. But I hope this information helps you for when you turn 16, which I believe is this year for almost all of you.

(16, 'sifath', 'The Genie Locker', 'The bus pulled around the corner and screeched to a stop. I groaned. The first day of school. I stepped onto the bus, trudged to the back, and threw my backpack onto a seat. I moved here from Delaware just last month, in August. My dad had a promotion, which is great, but that meant we had to pack our bags and move all the way to Washington, on the complete opposite side of the country. New house, new neighborhood, new state, new school, Iâ€™m surprised my head hasnâ€™t exploded. And even worse, Iâ€™m a seventh grader. Iâ€™m supposed to know all about the school and everything, but I donâ€™t even know where it IS. \r\nA girl walked up to me, and two girls followed her. They were tall, pretty, and wore way too much makeup. \r\nâ€œHi, Iâ€™m Charlotte. And this is Stacey and Ella. Youâ€™re new here?â€ she asked. I smiled. \r\nâ€œYeah. My nameâ€™s-â€œ\r\nâ€œSorry, but this is my seat, so move.â€ she said. \r\nâ€œI...um.â€ I stammered. \r\nâ€œYou heard me! MOVE!â€ she turned to her friends, and they snickered.\r\nI grabbed my stuff and moved to the front, behind the driver. He smelled like b.o. and cologne, somehow at the same time. I stared out the window, fighting back tears. Itâ€™s my first day at Gorsage Middle School, and Iâ€™m already pegged as a loser. Not that I had much hope in the first place. \r\nThe bus lurched forward, and we headed off to Gorsage. I looked down at my clothes. I had on a pair of tattered jeans, worn sneakers, and a t-shirt for some heavy metal band Iâ€™ve never even heard of; â€œCheat the Water Buffalo.â€ My big brother Tony gave it to me for my birthday. He acted like he was soooo generous to give me a â€œbrand newâ€ shirt, but I had helped transfer it from the bottom of his closet to the moving boxes. \r\nUgh.\r\nI reached into my backpack and pulled out my favorite copy of the Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy. It couldnâ€™t be much weirder, but I love it. Itâ€™s got a whole bunch of aliens and adventures through time and space and stuff. I opened it up and started reading. Then Charlotte, Stacey, and Ella walked to the front of the bus. Charlotte grabbed the book. \r\nâ€œWhat is this?â€ she jeered. She passed it to Ella. \r\nâ€œHey, give it back!â€ \r\nâ€œHitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy.â€ she read. â€œGross.â€ Stacey grabbed it. \r\nâ€œWhyâ€™s it gross?â€ she asked in a high pitched voice. \r\nâ€œBe quiet, Stacey. Your voice is so weird. Itâ€™s embarrassing.â€ Charlotte ordered. Stacey frowned and stared down at her feet. I tried to scoot farther into the bus seat, to disappear into it. News flash, it didnâ€™t work. \r\nâ€œGirls, give the lady her book back.â€ the bus driver said.\r\nâ€œWhat lady? All I see is this boy.â€ Ella teased. Ouch. Charlotte and Ella high-fived. Stacey threw the book at me,', 8, 0),
(17, 'sifath', 'Strings', 'I have the ability to see strings, connecting people. And the people they connect . . . theyâ€™re soul mates. Iâ€™ve seen it happen countless times, soul mates meeting for the first time. It would amaze you how many people meet their soul mates everyday.\r\nOne such day Iâ€™m sitting on the bus. Two people have already met each other at this rate Iâ€™ll have a new record. Yeah, I keep track, itâ€™s a bit weird but hey, normalcy is overrated.\r\nThe bus comes to a halt and a few people get on. One person has a string connecting them to the person Iâ€™m sitting next to. I held my breath wondering if they would sit next to each other. They didnâ€™t. I hate seeing people like this. Theyâ€™re just so oblivious to the fact that theyâ€™re sitting right next to their freaking soul mate.\r\nThe bus doors closed and we began to move when there was a shout. A boy was running behind the bus, arms waving. And he had a string connecting him to someone in the bus. As soon as I noticed this I stood and walked to the driver to point him out.\r\nThe bus stopped and the doors opened again. The boy caught up and got on. I had just sat back down waiting to see who ', 19, 1),
